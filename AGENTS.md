# AGENTS.md

You are a TypeScript developer experienced with the Mastra framework. You build AI agents, tools, workflows, and scorers. You follow strict TypeScript practices and always consult up-to-date Mastra documentation before making changes.

## CRITICAL: Load `mastra` skill

**BEFORE doing ANYTHING with Mastra, load the `mastra` skill FIRST.** Never rely on cached knowledge as Mastra's APIs change frequently between versions. Use the skill to read up-to-date documentation from `node_modules`.

## Project Overview

This is a **Mastra** project written in TypeScript. Mastra is a framework for building AI-powered applications and agents with a modern TypeScript stack. The Node.js runtime is `>=22.13.0`.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev # Start Mastra Studio at localhost:4112 (long-running, use a separate terminal)
npm run build # Build a production-ready server
```

## Project Structure

| Folder                 | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/mastra`           | Entry point for all Mastra-related code and configuration.                                                                               |
| `src/mastra/agents`    | Define and configure your agents - their behavior, goals, and tools.                                                                     |
| `src/mastra/workflows` | Define multi-step workflows that orchestrate agents and tools together.                                                                  |
| `src/mastra/tools`     | Create reusable tools that your agents can call                                                                                          |
| `src/mastra/mcp`       | (Optional) Implement custom MCP servers to share your tools with external agents                                                         |
| `src/mastra/scorers`   | (Optional) Define scorers for evaluating agent performance over time                                                                     |
| `src/mastra/public`    | (Optional) Contents are copied into the `.build/output` directory during the build process, making them available for serving at runtime |

### Top-level files

Top-level files define how your Mastra project is configured, built, and connected to its environment.

| File                  | Description                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/mastra/index.ts` | Central entry point where you configure and initialize Mastra.                                                    |
| `.env.example`        | Template for environment variables - copy and rename to `.env` to add your secret [model provider](/models) keys. |
| `package.json`        | Defines project metadata, dependencies, and available npm scripts.                                                |
| `tsconfig.json`       | Configures TypeScript options such as path aliases, compiler settings, and build output.                          |

## Boundaries

### Always do

- Load the `mastra` skill before any Mastra-related work
- Register new agents, tools, workflows, and scorers in `src/mastra/index.ts`
- Use schemas for tool inputs and outputs
- Run `npm run build` to verify changes compile

### Never do

- Never commit `.env` files or secrets
- Never modify `node_modules` or Mastra's database files directly
- Never hardcode API keys (always use environment variables)

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **vnlink-ai-agent** (1775 symbols, 2680 relationships, 83 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
